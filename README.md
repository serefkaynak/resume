## Features
I kept the functionality to a minimum and focused my time on replicating the fantastic styling. A few of my favourite CSS features include:
- Minimising header image on scroll
- Overflowing photo album on the home page
- Highlighted menu links (desktop view only)
- Blurred background when menu shown (mobile view only)
- Dark Mode
- A variety of great usable components for other projects

## Stack
- Tailwind CSS
